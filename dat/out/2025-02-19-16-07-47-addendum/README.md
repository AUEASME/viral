One of the natural N protein sequences I was provided (`natural.png`) vs. one the spam filters considered highly valid after 25,000 generations (`easmevolved.png`). Scores from the two layers were multiplied together, and this was from a run that functionally enforced subsequence conservation, as any specimens without the conserved sequences would automatically get a fitness of zero. The natural sequence has a fitness of 0.5003578 by these metrics, while the EASME sequence has a fitness of 0.5502967. The two do appear to be pretty different, pretty much regardless of which angle you look at them from, so I wonder if this would even assemble into the N capsule at all. I know we discussed structural deviation as a (negative) measure of fitness, so I may try implementing that over the next few days.

I could also do further conservation on the binding sites of the protein, but at that point I don't think there'd really be a point to evolving it at all...

It also seems even with the relatively light conservation done on these runs, there's still a pretty limited search space to explore, at least that the spam filter considers valid. Almost all the proteins left in generation 25,000 were generated between generations 40 and 50. (Generations produced ten unique children per generation, and the population was capped at a hundred individuals, with truncation used for survival selection.)

Interesting to note that the lowest-fitness individual in that final generation looks more like the highest-fitness individual than the natural sequence. So I wonder if there's some design trend the spam filter just really really likes.
